o Why are we doing this?
For some old town road school who didn't realize internet existed yet.
They will be able to create, save, update and delete students from a database, yaay.
o How I expected the challenge to go.
Terrible, my SpringBoot skills ar so blurry, thinking of changing my career into a street cleaner role.
o What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
StackOverflow went sooooo well, many thanks
H2 Console dependency, keep forgetting to add it lost hours trying to figure out why my code won't work.
Whitelabel Error got me into depression.
Push and Commit to GitHub killed 3 projects, left my machine being mean with myself, turned my machine on and it magically worked again for some reason, Git is so damn dangerous.
o Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
I hope not, i wanyt to create full detalied 3d models with 4k textures for a videogames corporation, not looking forward to small town road under a rock school management system that could be done on fiver.com .
o Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from
the API.
-will do
o Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
-easy as a pie
o Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report.
-missed the lesson hopefully by the time i'm being examinated some indian youtube guy or stackoverflow will save my life idk
o Link to Jira Board
-that won't be too creative as i don't have the time, deadline calls.
