# StudentManager

o Why are we doing this? <br>
For some old town road school who didn't realize internet existed yet. <br>
They will be able to create, save, update and delete students from a database, yaay. <br>
o How I expected the challenge to go. <br>
Terrible, my SpringBoot skills ar so blurry, thinking of changing my career into a street cleaner role. <br>
o What went well? / What didn't go as planned? <br>
StackOverflow went sooooo well, many thanks! <br>
H2 Console dependency, keep forgetting to add it lost hours trying to figure out why my code won't work. <br>
Whitelabel Error got me into depression. <br>
Push and Commit to GitHub killed 3 projects, left my machine being mean with myself, turned my machine on and it magically worked again for some reason, Git is so damn dangerous. <br>
o Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. <br>
Auto-Generated IDs, admin/student login system. <br>
o Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API. <br>
-will do <br>
o Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted. <br>
-easy as a pie <br>
o Screenshot of your test results, including coverage report. <br>
-missed the lesson hopefully by the time i'm being examinated some indian youtube guy or stackoverflow will save my life idk. <br>
o Link to Jira Board <br>
-that won't be too creative as i don't have the time, deadline calls. <br>
