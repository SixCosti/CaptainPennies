# StudentManager

o Why are we doing this? <br>
For a school to be able to manage student information entries. <br>
They will be able to create, save, update and delete students from a database. <br>
o How I expected the challenge to go. <br>
My SpringBoot skills are a bit blurry, but with the right documentation and hard work the result is there. <br>
o What went well? / What didn't go as planned? <br>
StackOverflow went so well, many thanks! <br>
H2 Console dependency, keep forgetting to add it lost hours trying to figure out why my code won't work. <br>
Whitelabel Error was one of the biggest obstacle until i've found a fix. <br>
Push and Commit to GitHub, I had a bit of trouble with that but I'm sure is an improvement and I'm getting better and better. <br>
o Possible improvements for future revisions of the project. <br>
Auto-Generated IDs, admin/student login system. <br>
o Screenshots showing the Postman requests and the output from the API. <br>
-will do <br>
o Screenshots of the database to prove that data is being persisted. <br>
-easy as a pie <br>
o Screenshot of the test results, including coverage report. <br>
-missed the lesson hopefully by the time i'm being examinated stackoverflow will save my life idk. <br>
o Link to Jira Board <br>
-Coming Soon, Jira is fun but time consuming but I like organising, Coming Soon. <br>
